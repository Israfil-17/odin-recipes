first project wohoo
ok so basically I gotta create a couple pages with html setting up the boilerplate, and using different tag like h1, p, a, img etc
nothing too hard about this project in fact it's all knowledge i've already had before 
Post completion comment:
I didn't have any problem with the project at all, had fun creating all the stuff and linking and finding images and also using git was fun tbh and i lazied out when creating the other two files and just copied the first one and edited it, i guess this is what programming is like lol
